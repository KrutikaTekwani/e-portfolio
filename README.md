# E-Portfolio Reflection

## Introduction

Welcome to my e-portfolio. This collection of work is a manifestation of my academic and personal journey at the University of St. Thomas. It showcases my development and growth as a Computer Science major with a minor in Statistics. Through a combination of technical skills, creativity, and a commitment to the common good, I strive to make a positive impact in the world.

## My Journey

The journey that led me to Computer Science was an unconventional one, sparked not by the traditional sequence of computing courses, but from an unlikely origin - biology. Originally a biology major, I found myself longing for a field that would ignite my passion and curiosity. Everything changed when I took a seemingly unrelated class, CISC130, an introduction to computer science.

During this course, I embarked on my first programming project, a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors." This simple yet engaging project, accessible in my portfolio [here](https://github.com/KrutikaTekwani/rock-paper-scissor), was a revelation. It demonstrated the power of logic, creativity, and problem-solving within the world of coding. It was a pivotal moment that led me to pursue computer science further.

This transition from biology to computer science opened up a world of possibilities. The freedom to create, the ability to solve complex problems, and the potential impact of software fascinated me. I realized that computer science aligned perfectly with my passion for using technology to make a difference in the world.

As I delved deeper into the major, I discovered more layers to my fascination. I recognized that coding was not only about designing and developing software but also about applying logic, improving efficiency, and creating real-world solutions. This realization led me to pursue a minor in Statistics, as I recognized the power of data analysis and predictive modeling in driving informed decision-making.

## Computer Science, Statistics, and the Common Good

As a Computer Science major with a minor in Statistics, I am equipped with the tools to harness the power of technology and data for the common good. Through my projects, I aim to address pressing issues and contribute to positive change in society.

One of the projects in my portfolio involves statistical data modeling. In this project, I carefully selected a dataset and developed a multiple linear regression model to understand the relationships between variables and predict future outcomes. You can explore this project [here](https://github.com/KrutikaTekwani/stat_data_modelling). By sharing this model, I hope to contribute to the collective understanding of data analysis and inspire others to leverage statistical modeling for making informed decisions.

Another exciting project in my portfolio is the EV3 Robotics Project, completed as part of my AI and Robotics class. In this project, I programmed an EV3 robot to write letters with a pen. The combination of artificial intelligence and robotics presented fascinating challenges and opportunities for creative problem-solving. You can learn more about this project [here](https://github.com/KrutikaTekwani/EV3_robotics_project).

Both these projects, along with the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, reflect my dedication to leveraging technology and data to advance the common good. By developing innovative solutions and promoting inclusivity, efficiency, and ethical conduct, I strive to make a positive impact aligned with the mission and values of St. Thomas.

##Conclusion

In conclusion, my e-portfolio represents my transformative journey as a Computer Science major at the University of St. Thomas. Through projects like the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, statistical data modeling, and the EV3 Robotics Project, I have embraced the mission of St. Thomas to educate morally responsible leaders who think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good.

I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that address pressing challenges and contribute to a better society. By combining my passion for Computer Science and Statistics, I strive to make a positive impact aligned with the mission and values of St. Thomas.

Thank you for exploring my e-portfolio, and I am excited to continue my journey as a morally responsible leader, dedicated to advancing the common good through technology.
